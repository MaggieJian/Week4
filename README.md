# Week 4: Collocation and unsupervised classification

The purpose of this GitHub page is to share the code I have used for Week 4 of the module named GEOL0069: Artificial Intelligence For Earth Observation (AI4EO) 2023/24. This module primarily uses sea ice and lead classification.

## Description

You will learn how to find lists of colocated images from pairs of satellites: collocated Sentinel-3 (300m resolution) and Sentinel-2 imagery (10m resolution) as well as collocated altimetry data from Sentinel-3. Unsupervised classification will be performed.

Therefore, this project is divided into two sections:
1) Colocating Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinal-2 Optical Data
2) Unsupervised Learning

Tasks to successfully classify the echoes in leads and sea ice in this project, you will produce:
1) An average echo shape
2) A standard deviation for these two classes
3) A confusion matrix to quantify echo classification against the ESA official classification
